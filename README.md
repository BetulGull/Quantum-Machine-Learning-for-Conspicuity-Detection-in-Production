# Conspicuity Detection in Production Using Hybrid Quantum Computing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conspicuity detection in production, enabling the identification of improvement measures for individual work steps or sub-processes at an early stage, thereby optimizing the production process. By analyzing process data, such as image data or time series, we aim to uncover deviations and weak points in production. Classical methods for analyzing such data are very time-consuming.

To address this, our project explores the potential of hybrid quantum computing to accelerate the process. Our primary focus lies in implementing the necessary hybrid quantum algorithms and rigorously benchmarking them against classical approaches, including machine learning and statistical methods.

## Why the Project is Useful

Detecting anomalies and weak points in production processes early on can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Hybrid quantum computing has the potential to process and analyze large datasets much faster than classical methods, leading to quicker identification and resolution of issues, thereby improving overall productivity and quality in production.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Familiarization with PennyLane and JAX

Initially, you need to familiarize yourself with PennyLane and its integration with JAX. To do this:

- Review the documentation and tutorial materials for PennyLane and JAX.
- Implement and present the PennyLane x JAX tutorial.

### Step 2: Implementing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)

We will tackle Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with different scaling approaches. In this step:

- Develop QNN prototypes using PennyLane and JAX.
- Present the results using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and visualization techniques.

### Step 3: Benchmarking Against Classical Methods

Finally, we will compare the performance of hybrid quantum algorithms with classical machine learning and statistical methods:

- Benchmark the hybrid quantum algorithms against classical methods.
- Visualize and compare the performance metrics.

## Dataset

We will be using the **Detecting Anomalies in Wafer Production** dataset, compiled by Fraunhofer. This unique dataset is crucial as the semiconductor industry is heavily invested in improving wafer production processes, positioning our project at the forefront of advancements in this sector.

## Results

- Detailed results and visualizations will be available in the `results` directory.
- Standard metrics used for evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
